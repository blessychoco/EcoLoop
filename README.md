# EcoLoop: Circular Economy Facilitator

EcoLoop is a decentralized platform that enables the sharing, repairing, and recycling of goods within communities, reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption.

## Features

- Add, update, and remove items for sharing or recycling
- Track user reputation based on community contributions
- Monitor the total number of items in the circular economy
- Manage item statuses (available, reserved, sold, repairing, recycled)
- Enforce input validation for data integrity and security

## Smart Contract

The EcoLoop smart contract is written in Clarity and provides the following main functions:

- `add-item`: Add a new item to the platform
- `update-item-status`: Update the status of an existing item
- `remove-item`: Remove an item from the platform
- `update-reputation`: Update a user's reputation (owner-only function)
- `get-item`: Retrieve information about a specific item
- `get-user-data`: Retrieve a user's data (reputation and item count)
- `get-total-items`: Get the total number of items on the platform
- `can-perform-action`: Check if a user meets the reputation threshold for certain actions
- `get-valid-statuses`: Retrieve the list of valid item statuses

### Security Features

- Strict input validation for item IDs and descriptions
- Predefined list of valid item statuses
- Maximum limit on items per user
- Owner-only functions for sensitive operations
